# AI Prompts

This folder contains AI prompts that support workflows, analysis, and preparation for Customer Success Managers. These prompts come directly from the AI Companion System and are used for stakeholder mapping, motivation analysis, and role specific understanding.

## Prompt: Stakeholder Map

"I'm a Customer Success Manager for a [type of product or platform] that helps companies with [primary use case].

Our solution delivers these outcomes:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]
- [Outcome 4]

Help me build a stakeholder map. Include anyone who might be influenced by our product, who might have a project that touches our product, or anyone who might be involved in the buying committee. Which stakeholders and departments should I prioritize for relationship building to ensure successful adoption and expansion?"

## Prompt: Stakeholder Motivations Table

"For each of those stakeholders, please summarize the following in a table, one stakeholder per row:
- What business outcomes and metrics matter most to this stakeholder
- How they typically measure success
- Common challenges they face
- How our solution addresses these challenges
- What risks might cause them to disengage or question our value"

## Prompt: Preparation for Role Specific Understanding

Use the outputs from the stakeholder map and motivation table to tailor future communication, agenda setting, and proactive outreach.
