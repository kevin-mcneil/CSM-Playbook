# Stakeholders and Personas

Regardless of product, most technical B2B software as a service accounts share patterns.

- Executive sponsors - care about outcomes, return on investment, and risk.
- Managers and team leads - care about team efficiency and reduced firefighting.
- Practitioners and power users - care about usability, speed, and stability.
- Adjacent teams - affected by data, alerts, workflows, or reports.
- Procurement and finance - care about cost, contract terms, and predictability.

Your job:

1. Identify them using AI, internal information, and customer calls.
2. Map what they care about including metrics, goals, and risks.
3. Align your conversations and materials to their priorities.
4. Multi thread relationships so your success does not depend on one person.
