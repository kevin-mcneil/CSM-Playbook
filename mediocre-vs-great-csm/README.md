# Mediocre vs Great Customer Success Manager

## Mediocre Customer Success Manager

Most Customer Success Managers fall into this category:

- Reactive:
  - Waits for tickets, emails, or complaints.
  - Only engages when something is broken or someone asks.

- Task focused instead of outcome focused:
  - “I will get that for you” instead of “Here is how we move you closer to your goal.”

- Shallow product understanding:
  - Knows where buttons are, does not know why features exist or when to recommend them.

- Weak communication hygiene:
  - No agendas, no structured follow ups, spotty customer relationship management notes.

- Single threaded relationships:
  - Only knows one champion. Renewal risk is invisible until it is too late.
