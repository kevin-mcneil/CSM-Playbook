# Purpose and Philosophy

This playbook is meant to be:

- Practical. Something you can run your actual work from.
- Generic. Not tied to any specific vendor or product.
- Opinionated. Biased toward what makes a great Customer Success Manager, not a mediocre one.
- Technical friendly. Assumes the product is at least somewhat technical such as security, infrastructure, or a software as a service platform.

Core idea:

A Great Customer Success Manager is a proactive, structured advisor who drives customer outcomes and adoption, not just a reactive coordinator who forwards emails.
