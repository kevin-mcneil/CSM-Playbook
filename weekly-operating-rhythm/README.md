# Weekly Operating Rhythm

## Monday: Strategy and Planning

Goal: Start the week with clarity on priorities across your whole portfolio.

1. Calendar Review
   - Look at all internal and external meetings for the week.
   - For each meeting, note:
     - Who is attending.
     - The primary purpose such as onboarding, health check, Quarterly Business Review, or incident review.
     - What preparation is required such as data pulls, decks, or internal sync.

2. Portfolio Review
   - Scan your accounts in the customer relationship management system or customer success tool.
   - Identify:
     - Upcoming renewals at ninety, sixty, or thirty days out.
     - Accounts with health score drops.
     - Accounts with stalled usage or projects.
     - Accounts with open escalations or tickets.

3. Task Creation
   - Turn findings into concrete tasks with owner and due date, such as:
     - “Prepare Quarterly Business Review deck for ACME by Thursday.”
     - “Schedule onboarding session number two with Contoso.”
     - “Review adoption metrics for Globex and propose next step features.”

4. Support and Escalation Check
   - Review open support cases for your accounts.
   - Ensure customers are updated regularly.
   - Log any needed follow ups as tasks.

5. Block Learning Time
   - Put one or two learning blocks on your calendar such as Wednesday and Friday mornings for:
     - Product updates.
     - New use cases.
     - Industry or security trends.
