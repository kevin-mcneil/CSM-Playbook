# Communication Patterns

Great CSM communication is:

- Clear
- Structured
- Outcome focused
- Shorter than you think it needs to be

General pattern for most customer emails:

1. Context in one sentence  
   "Following up on our call today about [topic]."

2. Key points, bulleted  
   - What we discussed  
   - Decisions made  
   - Observations

3. Actions and owners  
   - You:  
   - Us:  
   - Due:

4. Close with next step  
   - "If this looks good, I will proceed with X."  
   - "Would you be open to a session on Y next week?"

Keep:

- Quarterly Business Review emails - outcome and next steps focused
- At risk emails - empathetic, direct, and solution oriented
- Expansion emails - tied tightly to business objectives, not features
