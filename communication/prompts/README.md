# Communication Prompts

This folder contains the prompts used to create communication templates, messaging, and written outreach within the Customer Success Manager workflow.

These prompts come directly from the AI Companion System and are used to generate introduction emails, Quarterly Business Review summaries, at risk messages, and expansion opportunity messages.

## Prompt: Tailored Communication

"Using the stakeholder table we created, generate four communication templates:

1. An introduction email for a new stakeholder explaining our partnership vision
2. A Quarterly Business Review summary email highlighting value delivered to their department
3. An at risk account message addressing potential adoption challenges
4. An expansion opportunity message tied to their business objectives

For each template:
- Open with a specific pain point or opportunity relevant to their role
- Acknowledge their current approach and its limitations
- Explain how our solution delivers unique value for their situation
- Include a clear next step

Keep each message under one hundred fifty words, easily scannable, and jargon free."

## Prompt: Email Structure Reinforcement

General pattern for most customer emails:

1. Context in one sentence  
2. Key points, bulleted  
3. Actions and owners  
4. Close with next step

This structure should be reinforced in each generated message.

## Prompt: Role Based Framing

Use the output of the stakeholder table to adjust tone, priorities, and the value message to match the stakeholder type such as executive sponsor, manager, power user, or adjacent team.
